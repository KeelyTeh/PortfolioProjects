# Drought & Crops in Power BI
For this project, I created a Power BI presentation to  provide evidence regarding what crops survived and thrived recent Midwest drought conditions. I carried out this analysis on my own, before enrolling in CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and automation tasks commonly used by data analysts.

## Objective
My goal was to help inform farmers what crops to plant during mild to moderate droughts.

## Data 
This project combined drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor and crop production data from the County Agriculture Production Survey (CAPS) from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS). Data from the year 2022 was not included at the time of this analysis because crop production had not become available for that year. It becomes available each fall.
* US Drought Monitor Data by State (2018-2021)
* County Agriculture Production Survey by State, CAPS (2018-2021)

## Tools
* Power BI
* Excel
