# SQL Database for Food Company Project
For this project, I created a database for a fictitious food company, HealthySnacks, which manufactures and sales unique clean, natural food products to grocery chains. This project was completed on my own, before enrolling in my data analytics bootcamp. At that point in time, I had already studied SQL and had just taken an 8-hour course on database design and normalization. The purpose of this project was to enhance my SQL skills by understanding database design and normalization. This project also gave me to opportunity to apply my domain skills in food manufacturing to data analytics. 

## Objective
My goal was to enable the creation of a database that would optimize data storage and retrievel by being normalized and encouraging data integrity. This meant that the design of the database was designed according to database design conventions to make retrieval of information efficient and able to occur in the fewest number of steps, discourage the input of erroneous values, and maintain the proper relationships between tables of data.

## Data (fictional)
The data for this project can be found in the SQL scripts and in the database itself. All data is fictional and was created for the purposes of this project.
