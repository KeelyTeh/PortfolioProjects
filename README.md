# Drought & Crops in Power BI
For this project, I created a Power BI presentation to  provide evidence regarding what crops survived and thrived recent Midwest drought conditions. I carried out this analysis on my own, before enrolling in CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Program. The purpose of this project was to become familiar with data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and automation tasks commonly used by data analysts.

## Objective
My goal was to help inform farmers what crops to plant during mild to moderate droughts.

## Data (fictional)
The data for this project can be found in the SQL scripts and in the database itself. All data is fictional and was created for the purposes of this project.
* US Drought Monitor Data by State (2018-2022)
* County Agriculture Production Survey by State, CAPS (2018-2022)

## Tools
* Power BI
* Excel
