# Drought & Crops in Power BI
I have created a report in MS PowerBI focusing on the drought conditions and crop production for common commodities grown in the 
Midwest region of the United States. Years included are 2018 through 2021. The current year, 2022, was not included 
because crop production data for each year does not become available until the fall.

This project combined my interest and experience in food and agriculture with my passion for data analytics. I hope you enjoy reviewing the report 
as much as I enjoyed creating it.

See the report here:

About the Data
Drought Monitor and crop production data from the County Agriculture Production Survey (CAPS) from the National Agriculture Statistics Service (NASS).
** Drought Date **


## Key Highlights:
* Most crops, especially corn, have seen a decrease in production throughout dry to moderate conditions and severe to exceptional drought 
conditions in 2020 and 2021. Some crops such as flax, however, have only seen a significant decrease during extreme drought conditions but not during dry to moderate drought conditions.
* Cotton has done exceptionally well in dry and moderate drought conditions, as well as winter wheat.
* The Midwest states hit hardest by extreme drought conditions have been the west part of the region, in North Dakota and South Dakota.

## Please Note
For the first report tab, make sure you select a commodity, as that will ensure units displayed are the same, such as bu for corn, tons for hay, 
and so on. If you only select commodity, it will show drought and crop information for the whole Midwest for your selected commodity; commodity 
and state will show drought and commodity information for just that one state you select; while commodity, state, and county will focus on 
drought and crop production for your commodity in your chosen state and county.
