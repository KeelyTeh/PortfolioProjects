# Database in SQL
* For this project, I created a fictitious food company, Squeaky Clean Foods, which manufactures and sales unique clean, natural food products to grocery chains. 
* I combined my training in SQL and database design to create a fully optimized database. This prevents repeating date, enhances data integrity, and overall makes
  things easier for those who use the database.
* I automated the database with triggers that updated available quantities when an order was made or canceled. I also set up warning messages when an order
  was attempted that fell below MOQ (minimum order quantity) or exceeded the available quantity. 
* Code for a realistic view and stored procedure is also included.
